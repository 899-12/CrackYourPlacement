# Given an integer n and an integer array rounds. We have a circular track which consists of n sectors labeled from 1 to n. A marathon will be held on this track, the marathon consists of m rounds. 
#The ith round starts at sector rounds[i - 1] and ends at sector rounds[i]. For example, round 1 starts at sector rounds[0] and ends at sector rounds[1]

#Return an array of the most visited sectors sorted in ascending order.

#Notice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers in the counter-clockwise direction (See the first example).


class Solution:
    def mostVisited(self, n: int, rounds: List[int]) -> List[int]:

        end = rounds[-1]
        
        if start <= end:
            return list(range(start, end + 1))
        else:
            return list(range(1, end + 1)) + list(range(start, n + 1))
